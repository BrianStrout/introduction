        <h2>About Me Otherwise</h2>
        When not furthering my education and skill set in web development I
        spend time creating music, poetry, and occasionally art. I value
        traveling, meeting new people, and finding new experiences to enjoy. I
        have been learning Spanish and Portuguese.
