        <h2>My Professional Development...</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Brian Strout and I am a Jr. Front-End Web Developer
          looking for a good career opportunity with a company that would
          appreciate my self-taught, self-driven work ethic, as I further my
          understanding of the endless ways to keep improving.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Thus far the core of my learning has revolved around The Odin
          Project's Foundational and Full Stack Javascript curricula, with many
          a fun rabbit hold found along the way. I have learned and worked with
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Jest, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In my previous life I worked in facility management overseeing
          staffing, vendor contracts, maintenance, and emergency work for a high
          end residence building in Brookline Massachusetts. I have supervised
          multimillion dollars renovative projects, and been called in to stop
          buildings from flooding in the middle of the night, and learned how to
          navigate crises calmly and if possible with a smile. I have always
          carried a systematic approach to solving problems both in team
          environments and when work alone, all the while incorporating creative
          approaches and solutions as I can. I look forward to melding my
          previous work experiences and skills, creative approaches, and new
          found skills as they continue to grow.
