        <h2>My Professional Development...</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Thus far the core of my learning has revolved around The Odin
          Project's Foundation and Full Stack Javascript curricullum, and
          branching off into independent studies as needed. I have learned and
          worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In my previous life I most recently worked in facility management
          overseeing staffing, vendor contracts, maintenance, and emergency work
          for a high end residence building in Brookline Massachusetts. I have
          always carried a systematic approach to solving problems and enjoy
          incorporating creative approaches as I can.
